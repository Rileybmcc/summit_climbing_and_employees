Form to Create new Gym

When I visit the Parent Index page
Then I see a link to create a new Parent record, "New Parent"
When I click this link
Then I am taken to '/parents/new' where I  see a form for a new parent record
When I fill out the form with a new parent's attributes:
And I click the button "Create Parent" to submit the form
Then a `POST` request is sent to the '/parents' route,
a new parent record is created,
and I am redirected to the Parent Index page where I see the new Parent displayed.

<% form_with url: '/gyms', method: :post, local: true do |form|  %>
  <%= form.lable :name %>
  <%= form.text_feild :name %>

  <%= form.submit "Create Gym" %>
<% end %>
